## Tevon Davis — Full-Stack Software Developer

I'm Tevon, a software developer originally from Jamaica who enjoys building things that actually work in the real world. I’ve shipped full-stack products across industries like government, healthcare, fintech, and community platforms, often juggling both frontend and backend to get things across the finish line

Most of my work lives in the JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP world. I build with React on the frontend and use Node.js or PHP on the backend, depending on the job. I care about writing clean, understandable code and keeping things maintainable without overengineering. Every now and then I dabble in C# when the project calls for it.

P.S. My more interesting projects tend to be private, but feel free to reach out if you're curious.

#### Technical Competencies (Non exhaustive)

- **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, PHP, SQL, C#  
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Vite, Tailwind  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Laravel, Prisma, GraphQL  
- **Data:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, Firebase  
- **Testing:** Jest, Cypress, Mocha, Playwright, Artillery  
- **DevOps & Tools:** Git, GitHub Actions, Docker, Figma. All the usual suspects etc etc.

#### Currently

Exploring some experimental game mechanics, tuning up a few private projects, and always looking for ways to make good software feel simple.
